> Take a video and replace the face in it with a face of your choice. You only need one image of the desired face. No dataset, no training.

## Installation

Be aware, the installation needs technical skills and is not for beginners. Please do not open platform and installation related issues on GitHub. We have a very helpful [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/Y9p4ZQ2sB9) community that will guide you to install roop.

[Basic](https://roop-ai.gitbook.io/roop/installation/basic) - It is more likely to work on your computer, but will be quite slow

[Acceleration](https://roop-ai.gitbook.io/roop/installation/acceleration) - Unleash the full potential of your CPU and GPU
